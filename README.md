Desire2Learn_MobileApp
======================

This mobile application was a group project that came out of the want to have a
more usable mobile application for Radford's Desire 2 Learn course management system.

Another purpose to this assignment was to learn how to develop software using the
waterfall software development process. Each team member was in charge of one or more
phases of the process and was responsible for making sure that stage was completed successfully.

We were unfortunately unable to access some of the necessary APIs for this project so where we did
have a functional mobile application, it did not hook into our live D2L system.

The application was developed in JavaScript using Appcelerator. I personally did not get to write 
any code for this project. I did all of the design and wrote the user manual.
